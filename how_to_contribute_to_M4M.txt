1. Fork the M4M repository on GitHub and clone your fork to your development environment:
	git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/media-for-mobile.git

2. Add the main M4M repository as an additional git remote called "upstream". 
Change to the directory where you cloned M4M (normally it's media-for-mobile) and enter the following command:
	git remote add upstream git://github.com/M4M/media-for-mobile.git

3. Create an issue for the thing you are working on if it requires significant effort to fix.

4. Fetch the latest code from M4M master:
	git fetch upstream

5. Create a new branch for your feature based on the current M4M master branch. Each separate bug fix or change should go in its own branch.
	git checkout upstream/master
	git checkout -b <issue-number-branch-name>

6. Write your code.

7. Validate your changes and ensure that there is no regression in existing functionality using M4M sample application

8. Commit your changes:
	git commit -m "A brief description of this change"

9. Pull the latest code from upstream into your branch to ensure you have the latest code in your branch before you open your pull request:
	git pull upstream master

10. After resolving all conflicts, push your code to the GitHub:
	git push -u origin <issue-number-branch-name>

11. Open a pull request against upstream. Go to your repository on GitHub and click "Pull Request", choose your branch and enter details in the comment box.

12. M4M repository maintainers will review your code. If your code is accepted, it will be merged into M4M master branch

13. After your code was either accepted or declined you can delete branches you've worked with from your local repository and origin:
	git checkout master
	git branch -D <issue-number-branch-name>
	git push origin --delete <issue-number-branch-name>
